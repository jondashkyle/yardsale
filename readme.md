a very simple little site for items i’m selling. runs on choo.

## installation

- run `npm install` on the directory
- run `npm start` to serve
- run `npm build` to bundle the js

## usage

- all the content is contained in `items.json`
- all the images are contained in `/images`
- the json is loaded thru xhr, so no need to rebuild
